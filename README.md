# ox_template_server
New home of Judd's "Template Server", as he discontinued his repo I will still be contributing to this one for everybody. This contains resources for a *very basic* ESX server utilizing *oxmysql, ox_inventory, NPWD, esx_multicharacter (ox supported version)* as well as other *basic* resources to get you started.
```diff
- THIS IS NOT A FULL SERVER! Only a base to get you started.
+ This repo may NOT get updated often, so if you want certain updates you will need to do so yourself.
```
With that being said, right out the box everything is functional / usable. On the other hand, you will need to adjust some configs that will meet your needs.

### Main Resources
* [ox_inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory)
* [esx_multicharacter](https://github.com/thelindat/esx_multicharacter)
* [NPWD](https://github.com/project-error/npwd)
* [fivem-appearance](https://github.com/ZiggyJoJo/brp-fivem-appearance)
* [dx_hud](https://github.com/0xDEMXN/dx_hud)

### Extras
* [qidentification](https://github.com/katotekii/qidentification) --> qidentification has been setup to tie weapon / driver's license item to actual license required by weaponshop for example.
* [mdt](https://github.com/thelindat/mdt) --> thelindat's fork of hypaste's mdt.
* [linden_outlawalert](https://github.com/thelindat/linden_outlawalert) --> Per Linden this is broken/needs to be redone (take it or leave it but it does work in some basic scenarios).
* [luke_garages](https://github.com/LukeWasTakenn/luke_garages)
* **norp-vehicles** --> resource with 1 addon car to show setup for 1 resource for multiple vehicles.
* A few other various resources and tweaks done by (Judd#7644), (Fleevo#0001) & Me (qpr#7578).

## Notes
- Be sure to replace all of the "replaceme" text in server.cfg with your proper information
- To use photos for NPWD you need to follow the installation guide here - https://projecterror.dev/docs/npwd/start/installation#setting-up-camera-functionality 

## Support
I will *not* be providing direct support for this. I will keep it updated when I can but if you struggle using this then you will struggle with more. You will need to figure out things for yourself, use google, check cfx forums, ask in discords, etc.
